Note to FHIR implementers: Objective FHIR includes Status and Identifier fields on DomainResource because these two attributes occur in almost every FHIR resource. The most significant exception are 3 or 4 resources that use an 'active' flag instead of coded status value. There is no apparent pattern to this inconsistency. FHIR resources that use a coded status have active and inactive as status values. In the spirit of providing a consistent object-oriented logical model for FHIR, Objective FHIR uses status across all domain resources.{% endcapture %}{{ md_text | markdownify }}</td>

FHIR Notes:

Although FHIR supports the asserter (information source) and date asserted, it does not have a place for the author (who created and is responsible for the statement) and recorder (who entered the statement). Extensions are provided.

The treatment of 'not taken' has changed from DSTU2 and STU3 to R4. In R4, status and statusReason are used to indicate medications not taken. For upward compatibility, the 'not taken' attributes are profiled out.
ReasonCode is a choice of CodeableConcept or ref(Condition) in DSTU2, and limited to one reason (pick a type). In STU3 and R4, there can be multiple reason codes, and multiple reason references, simultaneously.

Preference is given to using the National Library of Medicine (NLM) RxNorm terminology for medications. RxNorm is a coding standard established by the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC). However, RxNorm is restricted to FDA-approved drugs and does not include clinical trial drugs. MedicationStatement allows for the inclusion of other coding systems like the NCI Thesaurus (NCIT) to represent clinical trial oncology drugs.{% endcapture %}{{ md_text | markdownify }}</td>

Observation has a value representing the result (answer), or an DataAbsentReason indicating why the value is not present. Things observed about the subject can include social and behavioral factors, subjective and objective observations, and assessments.
For an Observation, the Code describes the aspect or property of the subject being observed or measured. The Code is the 'question code' that pairs to the 'answer' contained in the Value.{% endcapture %}{{ md_text | markdownify }}</td>
