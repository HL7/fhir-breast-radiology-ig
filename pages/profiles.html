If this observation is present, and dataAbsentReason is not empty, then an architectural distortion was not observed and dataAbsentReason contains the reason why.


The parenchyma is distorted with no definite mass visible. For mammography, this includes thin
straight lines or spiculations radiating from a point, and focal retraction, distortion or straightening
at the anterior or posterior edge of the parenchyma. Architectural distortion may also be associ-
ated with a mass, asymmetry, or calcifications. In the absence of appropriate history of trauma or
surgery, architectural distortion is suspicious for malignancy or radial scar, and tissue diagnosis is
appropriate.
As an ASSOCIATED FEATURE, architectural distortion may be used in conjunction with another
finding to indicate that the parenchyma is distorted or retracted adjacent to the FINDING

If this observation is present, and dataAbsentReason is not empty, then an asymmetry was not observed and dataAbsentReason contains the reason why.


The several types of asymmetry involve a spectrum of mammographic findings that represent
unilateral deposits of fibroglandular tissue not conforming to the definition of a radiodense mass.
The asymmetry, unlike a mass, is visible on only 1 mammographic projection. The other 3 types of
asymmetry, although visible on more than 1 projection, have concave-outward borders and usu-
ally are seen to be interspersed with fat, whereas a radiodense mass displays completely or partially
convex-outward borders and appears to be denser in the center than at the periphery.

Enlarged axillary lymph nodes may warrant comment, clinical correlation, and additional

A review of the patient’s medical history may elucidate the cause for axillary adenopathy, averting
recommendation for additional evaluation. When one or more large axillary nodes are 
substantially composed of fat, this is a normal variant.

Breast Radiology Mammography Breast Density Observation


The following four categories of breast composition are defined by the visually estimated content of fibroglandular-density tissue within the breasts. Please note that the 
categories are listed as a, b, c, and d so as not to be confused with the numbered BI-RADS® assessment categories. If the breasts are not of apparently equal density, the 
denser breast should be used to categorize breast density. The sensitivity of mammography for noncalcified lesions decreases as the BI-RADS® breast density category 
increases. The denser the breast, the larger the lesion(s) that may be obscured. There is considerable intra- and inter-observer variation in visually estimating breast density 
between any two adjacent density categories. Furthermore, there is only a minimal and insignificant difference in the sensitivity of mammography between the densest breast 
in a lower-density category and the least dense breast in the next-higher-density category. These factors limit the clinical relevance of breast density categorization for the 
individual woman.

If this observation is present, and dataAbsentReason is not empty, then a calcification was not observed and dataAbsentReason contains the reason why and no Type or Distribution observations should be referenced by this observation


Calcifications that are assessed as benign at mammography are typically larger, coarser, round with
smooth margins, and more easily seen than malignant calcifications. Calcifications associated with
malignancy (and many benign calcifications as well) are usually very small and often require the use
of magnification to be seen well. When a specific typically benign etiology cannot be assigned, a
description of calcifications should include their morphology and distribution. Calcifications that are
obviously benign need not be reported, especially if the interpreting physician is concerned that
the referring clinician or patient might infer anything other than absolute confidence in benignity
were such calcifications described in the report. However, typically benign calcifications should be
reported if the interpreting physician is concerned that other observers might misinterpret them as
anything but benign were such calcifications not described in the report.
As an ASSOCIATED FEATURE, this may be used in conjunction with one or more other FINDING(S)
to describe calcifications within or immediately adjacent to the finding(s)

A "MASS" is three dimensional and occupies space. It is seen on two different mammographic pro-
jections. It has completely or partially convex-outward borders and (when radiodense) appears
denser in the center than at the periphery. If a potential mass is seen only on a single projection, it
should be called an "ASYMMETRY" until its 3-dimensionality is confirmed (See Section D on Asym-
metries and also the Guidance chapter). (Insert links/page #s)

These are circumscribed masses that are reniform and have hilar fat. They are generally 1 cm or smaller
in size. They may be larger than 1 cm and characterized as normal when fat replacement is pro-
nounced. They frequently occur in the lateral and usually upper portions of the breast closer to the
axilla, although they may occur anywhere in the breast. They usually are seen adjacent to a vein,
because the lymphatic drainage of the breast parallels the venous drainage.

Radiographic density is considered an important feature in the evaluation of noncalcified breast masses, yet
no studies assessing its value have been published. The radiographic densities of 91 biopsy-proved, nonfatty,
noncalcified breast masses were evaluated by three mammographers. The density determinations made by
each observer were compared with the histologic outcome for the 51 benign and 40 malignant lesions. With
the kappa statistic, interobserver agreement was relatively poor (0.22 to 0.49), and intraobserver agreement for
one expert mammographer was 0.50. When the majority opinion of the mammographers was used, sensitivity
was 48%, specificity was 80%, and both positive and negative predictive values were 66%. As a solitary feature
in lesion analysis, mammographic density is difficult to assess and is of limited value for the prediction of the
benign or malignant nature of noncalcified breast masses.

The nipple is pulled in. This should not be confused with nipple inversion, which is often bilateral 
and which in the absence of any suspicious findings and when stable for a long period of time, 
is not a sign of malignancy. However, if nipple retraction is new, suspicion for underlying malignancy is increased.

Breast Radiology Ultra-Sound Mass Echo Pattern Observation


The echogenicity of most benign and malignant masses is hypoechoic compared with 
mammary fat. While many completely echogenic masses are benign, prospective assessment as
benign has greater dependency on marginal circumscription. Although the echo pattern
contributes with other feature categories to the assessment of a breast lesion, echogenicity
alone has little specificity.

This feature of masses is unique to US imaging. Orientation is defined with reference to the skin
line. Obliquely situated masses may follow a radial pattern, and their long axes will help determine
classification as parallel or not parallel. Parallel or "wider-than-tall" orientation is a property of most
benign masses, notably fibroadenomas; however, many carcinomas have this orientation as well.
Orientation alone should not be used as an isolated feature in assessing a mass for its likelihood of
malignancy.

Posterior acoustic features represent the attenuation characteristics of a mass with respect to its
