        <li>Fibroglandular - Scattered areas of fibroglandular density</li>
        <li>HeterogeneouslyDense - The breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure detection of small masses</li>
        <li>ExtremelyDense - The breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography.</li>
