	<p>
		Breast radiology is a very narrow and highly 
		specialized niche of medicine which is 
		predominantly, but not exclusively, focused on 
		screening, diagnosing and guiding treatment of 
		breast cancer.
	</p>
	<p>
		Breast radiology is also unique in that most 
		studies are read by specialists that are solely 
		focused on this singular body location and collection 
		of modalities and techniques that are narrowly focused.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is also worth noting that this field was the very 
		first to explore specific regulatory requirements for 
		encoding information for standardized categorization of 
		clinical status and to mandate precise communications 
		between the radiologist, referring physician and 
		patient, including bi-annual screening reminder letters 
		among others.
