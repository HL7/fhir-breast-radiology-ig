   </p>
   <p>
   Breast Radiology Diagnostic Report is one of the components of a Breast Radiology Document.
   </p>
   <p>
   Each Breast Radiology Document bundle will contain exactly one
   Breast Radiology Document instance that is referenced in the
   document's 'Report' section.
   </p>
   <p>
   This instance will contain the top level results of the exam,
   including the narrative result.
   </p>
   <p>
   The report may be a 'traditional' mammography report, or it may be a newer type of report such as a
   "3D mammography exam report". The Breast Radiology Document contains sections for commonly used modalities
   such as mammography, ultrasource and nuclear medicine, and also has a place for 'other' modalities.
