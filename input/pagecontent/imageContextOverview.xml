	The Breast Radiology Report uses imaging data for many of the determinations performed during an exam.
	The ability to annotate an image in a manner that is transmittable and storable is crucial to
	documenting a finding based on imaging data.
	</p>
	<p>
	Included in this Implementation guide is the ImagingContext FHIR extension which provides the
	ability to add image annotations to a FHIR DocumentReference resource.
