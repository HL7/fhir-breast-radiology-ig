    A Breast Radiology Document is an implementation of a Fhir Document. It is comprised of a Fhir Bundle
    with a top level Fhir Composition Resource that contains links to all the resources included in the
    Breast Radiology Report.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Breast Radiology Document is an atomic item, meaning that no part in it can be changed without changing the entire
    bundle, and that all the parts are contained and in a single bundle.
