   </p>
   <P>
   A Breast Imaging Document is an implementation of a FHIR Document.
   </P>
   <P>
   A FHIR Document is a Bundle that provides a single item containing all the 
   resource instances that are a part of the Breast Imaging Diagnostic Report.
   </P>
   <P>
   The Breast Imaging Document is an atomic item, meaning that no part in 
   it can be changed without changing the entire bundle, and that 
   all the parts are contained in a single bundle  
   </P>
   <P>
   The first entry in the bundle is a composition instance that provides an index
   to all the other FHIR resource instances that are part of this document.
   This index composition entry must be an instance of the BreastImagingComposition profile.
