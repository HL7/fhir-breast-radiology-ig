     <u style="font-size:large;">Description</u>
   </p>
   <p>
   This resource is one of the components of a Breast Imaging Composition.
   </p>
   <p>
   Each Breast Imaging Composition will contain exactly one
   Breast Imaging Report instance that is referenced in the
   composition's 'Report' section.
   </p>
   <p>
   This instance will contain the top level results of the exam,
   including the narrative result.
   </p>
   <p>
   The report may be a 'traditional' mammography report, or it may be a newer type of report such as a
   "3D mammography exam report". The Breast Imaging Document contains sections for commonly used modalities
   such as mammography, ultrasource and nuclear medicine, and also has a place for 'other' modalities.
