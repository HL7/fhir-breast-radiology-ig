      "definition": "The axillary nodes are a group of lymph nodes located\nin the axillary (or armpit)\nregion of the body.\nAuxillary nodes perform the vital function of filtration\nand conduction of lymph from the upper\nlimbs, pectoral region, and upper back.\nThere are five axillary lymph node groups,\nnamely the lateral (humeral), anterior (pectoral),\nposterior (subscapular), central\nand apical nodes."

      "definition": "Swollen lymph nodes usually occur as a result of\ninfection from bacteria or viruses.\nRarely, swollen lymph nodes are caused by cancer.\nLymph nodes, also called lymph glands, play a vital\nrole in the body's ability\nto fight off infections.\nLymph nodes function as filters, trapping viruses,\nbacteria and other causes of illnesses\nprior to infecting the body.\n\nCommon areas subject to swollen lymph nodes include\nthe neck, under chin,  armpits and groin."
