Skin calcifications\r\nare most commonly seen along the inframammary fold, parasternally, overlying the axilla \r\nand around the areola. The individual calcific particles usually are tightly grouped, with individual \r\ngroups smaller than 5 mm in greatest dimension. Atypical forms may be confirmed\r\nas skin deposits by performing additional mammographic views tangential to the overlying\r\nskin. Also note that if suspicious-appearing calcifications are adjacent to a skin surface on\r\na given mammographic view, they actually may be dermal (hence benign) in nature, so that\r\ntangential-view mammography with or without magnification should be done prior to any\r\nintervention.\r\n    -- Bi-Rads® Atlas — Mammography Fifth Ed. 2013"

A small percentage of\r\nthese calcifications may have lucent centers if the calcium is in the wall of the duct (periductal),\r\nbut most are intraductal, when calcification forms within the lumen of the duct. All large\r\nrod-like calcifications follow a ductal distribution, radiating toward the nipple, occasionally\r\nbranching. The calcifications usually are bilateral, although they may be seen in only one\r\nbreast, especially when few calcific particles are visible.

Fat necrosis and calcifications in the walls of cysts are the most common \"rim\"\r\ncalcifications, although more extensive (and occasionally thicker-rimmed) calcification in the\r\nwalls of oil cysts or simple cysts may be seen.\r\n    -- Bi-Rads® Atlas — Mammography Fifth Ed. 2013"

The most important feature of these calcifications\r\nis the apparent change in shape of the calcific particles on different mammographic\r\nprojections (craniocaudal versus occasionally the MLO view and especially LM/ML views). At\r\ntimes milk of calcium calcifications are seen adjacent to other types of calcifications that may\r\nbe associated with malignancy, so it is important to search for more suspicious forms, especially \r\nthose that do not change shape from the 90º lateral projection to the CC projection.\r\n    -- Bi-Rads® Atlas — Mammography Fifth Ed. 2013"
