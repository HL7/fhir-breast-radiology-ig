Numerous bilateral groups of coarseheterogeneous calcifications usually may be dismissed as benign, although baseline magnificationviews may be helpful.

All largerod-like calcifications follow a ductal distribution, radiating toward the nipple, occasionallybranching.

On the craniocaudal image they are often less evident and appear as round,smudgy deposits, while occasionally on MLO and especially on 90� lateral (LM/ML) views,they are more clearly defined and often semilunar, crescent shaped, curvilinear (concave up),or linear, defining the dependent portion of cysts. The most important feature of these calcificationsis the apparent change in shape of the calcific particles on different mammographicprojections (craniocaudal versus occasionally the MLO view and especially LM/ML views). Attimes milk of calcium calcifications are seen adjacent to other types of calcifications that maybe associated with malignancy, so it is important to search for more suspicious forms, especially those that do not change shape from the 90� lateral projection to the CC projection.\r\nValid for the following modalities: MG."

Atypical forms may be confirmedas skin deposits by performing additional mammographic views tangential to the overlyingskin. Also note that if suspicious-appearing calcifications are adjacent to a skin surface ona given mammographic view, they actually may be dermal (hence benign) in nature, so thattangential-view mammography with or without magnification should be done prior to anyintervention.\r\nValid for the following modalities: MG."
