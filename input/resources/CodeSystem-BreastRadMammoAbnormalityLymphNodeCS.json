They may be larger than 1 cm and characterized as normal when fat replacement is pro-\r\nnounced. They frequently occur in the lateral and usually upper portions of the breast closer to the\r\naxilla, although they may occur anywhere in the breast. They usually are seen adjacent to a vein,\r\nbecause the lymphatic drainage of the breast parallels the venous drainage.\r\n    -- Bi-Rads® Atlas — Mammography Fifth Ed. 2013"
