      "definition": "Focal asymmetry is visible as a confined asymmetry with a similar shape on two views but does not fit the criteria of a mass: that is, it lacks convex outer borders and conspicuity (,Fig 4,,). \r\nIn contrast to global asymmetry, it occupies a volume of less than one quadrant of the breast and is of more concern. \r\nThe frequency of finding focal asymmetry at screening mammography is less than 1%. \r\n-- https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/rg.e33\r\nValid for the following modalities: MG."

      "definition": "Global asymmetry in breast tissue is a form of breast asymmetry where at least one quadrant of a breast has a larger amount of fibroglandular density than the corresponding area in the contralateral breast. \r\nThere is no mass, suspicious calcification, or architectural distortion. \r\n-- https://radiopaedia.org/articles/global-asymmetry-in-breast-tissue?lang=us\r\nValid for the following modalities: MG."

      "display": "Developing Asymmetry",
      "definition": "A developing asymmetry is a focal asymmetry that is new or increased in conspicuity compared with the previous mammogram. \r\nIt is challenging to evaluate, as it often looks similar to fibroglandular tissue at mammography. \r\nA developing asymmetry should be viewed with suspicion because it is an uncommon manifestation of breast cancer. \r\n-- https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/rg.2016150123\r\nValid for the following modalities: MG."
