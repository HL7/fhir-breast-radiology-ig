Rarely, swollen lymph nodes are caused by cancer.\r\nYour lymph nodes, also called lymph glands, play a vital role in your body's ability to fight off infections. They function as filters, trapping viruses, bacteria and other causes of illnesses before they can infect other parts of your body. Common areas where you might notice swollen lymph nodes include your neck, under your chin, in your armpits and in your groin.\r\nValid for the following modalities: MG US."

They may be larger than 1 cm and characterized as normal when fat replacement is pronounced. \r\nThey frequently occur in the lateral and usually upper portions of the breast closer to the\r\naxilla, although they may occur anywhere in the breast.
