Since this\r\ndistribution may involve most of a quadrant or even more than a single quadrant, malignancy\r\nis less likely. However, overall evaluation of regional calcifications must include particle shape\r\n(morphology) as well as distribution."

The lower limit for use of this descriptor is usually when 5 calcifications are grouped\r\nwithin 1 cm of each other or when a definable pattern is identified. The upper limit for use\r\nof this descriptor is when larger numbers of calcifications are grouped within 2 cm of each other."

This distribution may elevate suspicion for malignancy,\r\nas it suggests deposits in a duct.

      "definition": "[Bi-Rads® Atlas — Mammography Fifth Ed. 2013]\r\nCalcifications in a segmental distribution are of concern because they suggest deposits in a\r\nduct or ducts and their branches, raising the possibility of extensive or multifocal breast cancer\r\nin a lobe or segment of the breast. Although benign causes of segmental calcifications exist\r\n(e.g. large rod-like), the smooth, rod-like morphology and large size of benign calcifications\r\ndistinguish them from finer, more pleomorphic or heterogeneous malignant calcifications.\r\nA segmental distribution may elevate the degree of suspicion for calcifications such as punctate or amorphous forms."
