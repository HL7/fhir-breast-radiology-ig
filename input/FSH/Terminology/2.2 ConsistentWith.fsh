    X-ray artifacts can present in a variety of ways

    on a radiograph or degraded image quality, and have

    (post-processing) artifacts.
    There are common and distinct artifacts for film,

    Common causes are improper handling of the films
    errors while processing the films
    patient movement while taking the image.

    Skin calcifications in the breast usually form in

    Calcifications may also form in moles and other skin
    lesions.
    Often, these calcifications are in groups as they

    Yes.
    Breast tissue is composed of functional elements

    sacs (cysts) and more prominent scar-like (fibrous)
    tissue, which can make breasts
    feel tender, lumpy or ropy.
    Fibrocystic breasts are composed of tissue that feels

    The lymph nodes are connected to one another by
    lymph vessels.
    Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck, axilla

    Different types of solid mass/ tumors are named for
    the type of cells that form them.
    Examples of solid tumors are sarcomas, carcinomas,
    and lymphomas.
    Leukemias (cancer of the blood) generally do not
    form solid mass/tumors.
    A vascular tumor is a type of tumor that forms from
    cells that make blood vessels
    or lymph vessels.
    Vascular tumors may be benign (not cancer) or malignant
    (cancer) and can occur anywhere
    in the body.
