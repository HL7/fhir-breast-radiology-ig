    Breast papillary lesions are characterised by growth
    inside the milk ducts, and they
    represent a heterogeneous pathology.
    They are rare and constitute less than 10% of benign
    breast lesions and less than
    1% of malignant breast neoplasms.
    Breast papillary lesions are usually detected by
    imaging or clinically by the presence
    of a palpable breast mass or unilateral spontaneous
    nipple discharge.

    Phyllodes tumors of the breast are rare, accounting
    for less than 1% of all breast
    tumors.
    The name 'phyllodes,' which is taken from the Greek
    language and means 'leaflike,' refers
    to that fact that the tumor cells grow in a leaflike
    pattern.
    Other names for these tumors are phylloides tumor
    and cystosarcoma phyllodes.
    Phyllodes tumors tend to grow quickly, but they rarely
    spread outside the breast.
    Although most phyllodes tumors are benign (not cancerous),
    some are malignant (cancerous)
    and some are borderline (in between noncancerous
    and cancerous).
    All three kinds of phyllodes tumors tend to grow
    quickly, and they require surgery
    to reduce the risk of a phyllodes tumor coming back
    in the breast (local recurrence).
