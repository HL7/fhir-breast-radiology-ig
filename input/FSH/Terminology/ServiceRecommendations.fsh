    A Scintimammogram guided biopsy is recommended.
    This is performed by taking samples of an abnormality

    Scintimammography uses small amounts of radioactive
    material, a special camera and a computer to help
    investigate a breast abnormality.
    This helps to guide the radiologist's biopsy equipment
    
    to the site of the imaging abnormality.

    A scintimammogram is recommended.
    Scintimammography is also known as nuclear medicine
    breast imaging, Breast Specific
    Gamma Imaging (BSGI) and Molecular Breast Imaging
    (MBI).
    This type of exam is used to investigate a breast
    abnormality found with mammography.
    Scintimammography uses small amounts of radioactive
    material, a special camera and
    a computer to help investigate a breast abnormality.
    Scintimammography can detect cancer even when dense
    breast tissue and breast implants
    are present.
    It can reduce unnecessary procedures by helping determine
    whether a biopsy is needed.

    A spot compression is recommended.
    A spot view (also known as a spot compression view
    or focal compression view) is
    an additional mammographic view performed by applying
    the compression to a smaller
    area of tissue using a small compression paddle,
    increasing the effective pressure
    on that spot.
    This results in better tissue separation and allows
    better visualization of the breast
    tissue in that area.
    It is used to distinguish between the presence of
    a true lesion and an overlap of
    tissues, as well to better show the borders of an
    abnormality or questionable area
    or a little cluster of faint microcalcifications
    in a dense area.

    Surgical biopsies can be excisional (removal of an
