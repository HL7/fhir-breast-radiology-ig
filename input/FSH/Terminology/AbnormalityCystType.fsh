* #Cyst "Cyst"
    """
    A cyst is a sac-like pocket of membranous tissue
    that contains fluid, air, or other
    substances.
    Cysts can grow almost anywhere in the body or under
    the skin.
    """

* #CystComplex "Cyst complex"
    """
    Complex cysts have irregular or scalloped borders,
    thick walls, and some evidence
    of solid areas and/or debris in the fluid.
    These solid areas echo back the sound waves from
    the ultrasound.
    A complex cyst is sometimes aspirated, or drained
    with a fine needle, so that the
    fluid inside can be tested.
    If blood or any unusual cells are present, further
    testing may be needed to rule
    out breast cancer.

* #CystComplicated "Cyst complicated"
    """
    Complicated cysts are 'in between' simple and complex.
    Although they share most of the features of simple
    cysts, they tend to have some
    debris inside them and echo back some of the ultrasound
    waves.
    However, they don't have the thick walls or obvious
    solid components that a complex
    cyst has.
