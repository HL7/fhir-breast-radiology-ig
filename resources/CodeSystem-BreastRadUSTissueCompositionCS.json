  "description": "Breast Radiology Ultra-Sound Tissue Composition Observation\n\n\n> The wide normal variability in tissue composition seen on mammograms can also be observed\n> on US images. Just as increasing breast density diminishes the sensitivity of mammography in the\n> detection of small masses, heterogeneous background echotexture of the breast may affect the\n> sensitivity of breast sonograms for lesion detection.\n>> -- BI-RADS® ATLAS — MAMMOGRAPHY FIFTH EDITION — 2013",

Shadowing may occur at the interfaces of fat\r\nlobules and parenchyma. This pattern occurs in younger breasts and those with heterogeneously\r\ndense parenchyma depicted mammographically. Whether and how this pattern affects the sensitivity\r\nof sonography merits study, but technical maneuvers may help resolve interpretive dilemmas\r\nthat occasionally result in unnecessary biopsy.\r\n    -- -- (BI-RADS® ATLAS — MAMMOGRAPHY FIFTH EDITION — 2013)"
