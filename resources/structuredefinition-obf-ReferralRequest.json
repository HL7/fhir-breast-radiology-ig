Establishing the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation, and\n2. Specifying the direction and distance from the landmark to the body location.\nNote that BodyLocation is a data type, a reusable structure, not a stand-alone entity. The concept is similar to how a postal address can apply to a person, location, or organization.
