The body location can also be specified in relation to one or more body landmarks. SNOMED CT is used in all cases.\n\n* Code only: The code should include (precoordinate) laterality and/orientation to the degree necessary to completely specify the body location.\n* Code plus laterality and/or orientation: The basic code augmented by codes specifying the body side and/or anatomical orientation.\n* Relation to landmark: The location relative to a landmark is specified by:\n1. Establishing the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation, and\n2. Specifying the direction and distance from the landmark to the body location.\n\nNote that BodyLocation is a data type (a reusable structure), not a stand-alone entity. The concept is similar to how a postal address can apply to a person, location, or organization. This contrasts with FHIR's stand-alone BodySite (aka BodyStructure in r4) which 'is not ... intended for describing the type of anatomical location but rather a specific body site on a specific patient' (FHIR 3.5).",
